### Description
Upload an image of a lesion and receive an estimate of it being Melanoma or not. Our algorithm will try to analyze the image using the same ABC features that dermatologists use in clinical practice.
The algorithm is a balanced logistic regression model trained on the PAD-UFES-20 dataset.

### Tech stack
- Next.js
- Tailwind
- ShadCN
- Typescript

### Made by
The website was built as a hobby project by Philip Münster-Hansen.
The algorithm was built by Asta Trier Wang, Bruno Alessandro Damian Modica Figueira, Jan Peter Cardell, Maja Kalina Oska, and Philip Münster-Hansen. This algorithm was developed as part of the “Projects in Data Science” course at the IT University of Copenhagen.

### Motivation behind
Building and testing the algorithm was a lot of fun. However, creating algorithms in controlled environments and making them work in the real world are two very different challenges.

I built this website to try and take this project into the real world so friends and family can try the technology themselves.

### Disclamer
Melanoma detection is extremely complex, and achieving reliable results is not easy. Unfortunately, this project is no exception. Result are very unstable and should therefore not be seen as medical advice.
